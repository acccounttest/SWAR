#SWAR, a skyrim mod for all your mods, yes again.
--------------------------------------------------
A simple JAVA program that promise it does not break any game functionnality or normal behavior, unlike most of all the concept that are similarely based(or reduced) work and other ideas that are often coded inside the game, only as mod, probably the reason of the uncompatibilities and bugs, the major cause of CTD, i am not the only one to mod the game from outside(by id or string), other patcher types and real framework did and are complementary even if theses tools have been rewritten as well others.

The program concept is read all mods and let the user recognize, sort, choose, whitelist and blacklist items to let NPC use the same effects and triggers of items(all counfounded) in all circumstances, normally with all prerequesites, their powers should be approximately not far of a dragon child.

Another JAVA program that nexus had ovewritted by a obfuscated version to avoid any future project reusage, basically it come from a framework and another similar project found on nexus, it reuse the parsing tool that tend to include the most materials, components and principles into the read of the mod extensions, the patch for SSE was included in latest framework patch but not for all and was canceled and rewritten in another language and framework.
This isn't even experimented, the SSE has not been tested, this version of skyrim include more extensions that definitely cannot be read and are unrecognized, this is a insignificant part of the total of content usually needed in the compatible formats.


**This is the reason there is no source, the program is accessible though the Nexus 88826**
